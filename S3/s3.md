# S3 (Simple Storage Device)

S3 is storage web service,which is a storage engine which is used to store and retrieve any amount of data.\
 We have to create Bucket inside S3 to store the data. A bucket is a container (web folder) for objects (files) stored in Amazon S3. Buckets form the top-level namespace for Amazon S3, and bucket names are global.\
  This means that your bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts We can also do web-hosting on s3 if the pages are static or dynamic pages are created react only.

## Steps to create bucket :
